## Tobias Rossen – Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio. This repository serves as an overview of a selected portion of the projects I’ve worked on — both personal, professional and school related. Some are still in progress, while others are complete or in use.

Feel free to browse the ones available publicly. For any private projects, I’m happy to grant access upon request.

## Improvement to Internal Notification System – *Danske Spil A/S*  
#### C#, ASP.NET Core, EF Core, Azure SQL Database (backend), Mithril.js (frontend)  

A full-stack enhancement to Danske Spil’s internal messaging system used to notify users about outages and service updates.  
I implemented functionality allowing staff to update the destination of already-sent messages, eliminating the need to delete and recreate them — significantly improving operational efficiency and reducing the risk of human error.  

> This project is proprietary and hosted internally at Danske Spil, so it is not available in this repository.

**STATUS:** Ready for QA testing.

## Signup Flow – *Danske Spil A/S*  
#### React, Sitecore *(with minor backend updates in C#, ASP.NET Core/EF Core)*  
 
A frontend project for Danske Spil, where I developed the user-facing sign-up flow using React. I also made minor updates to the backend API to ensure proper integration, fixing small issues in newly created endpoints.  

> This project is also proprietary and hosted internally at Danske Spil.

**STATUS:** In testing. Scheduled for production deployment in fall 2025

## BI_Exam - *School project*  
#### Python *(streamlit, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib)*

[View Repository](https://github.com/TRossen89/BI_Exam) 

**Grade:** 12 (A)  

Created as part of a Business Intelligence module in my AP Computer Science (Datamatiker) studies. I analyzed data on GDP, social expenditure, unemployment, taxation, and happiness across countries to build models predicting the GDP of countries and to visualize interesting relations between GDP and happiness, social expenditure, unemployment and taxation.  

**Note:** Install the following dependencies using `pip install` to run the app: `streamlit pandas matplotlib seaborn table scikit-learn`

**STATUS:** Finished.

## Backend API for Project Showcase  
#### Java, JPA  
[View Repository](https://github.com/TRossen89/tobias-rossen-backend)  
A RESTful backend service designed to support a personal homepage showcasing my work. The API will provide endpoints for project info, tags, video presentations and more.  
I've made 3 projects in school resembling the structure of this project.  

**STATUS:** In development.

## Budget App  

#### Python, Kivy

[View Repository](https://github.com/TRossen89/the-budget-app-proto-type)

<!-- [Video Presentation - long functionality demo](https://youtu.be/dkUspd2dphs) -->

A personal budgeting app I developed when I first started programming. The repository contains a main branch with the original design and a development branch where I experimented with various changes. 
Although the app is unfinished and not very user-friendly, I still actively use it to track and plan my spending over defined periods. I've decided to stop development on this version and instead start a new project based on a redesigned concept I've worked on. The new version will be built using a React frontend and a Java or C# backend.  

**Note:** Install the following dependency using `pip install` to run the app: `kivy`

**STATUS:** Not finished. Development discontinued.

## Confirmation Board Game 
#### Python, Kivy

<!-- [Video Presentation - long functionality demo](https://youtu.be/_-OWkPrC2eE) -->

A playful digital board game I built for my cousin’s daughter’s confirmation (*konfirmation*). I used PyInstaller to collect it in a executable file.

> This project is currently private. If you're interested in the code feel free to reach out and I’ll be happy to grant access.

**STATUS:** Finished.

## Why include private/proprietary projects?

While I can’t share code for some of my work at Danske Spil, I include them to provide insight into the kind of real-world challenges I’ve solved, and the technologies I’ve worked with in a professional setting. I’m happy to discuss any of these in more detail during a conversation or interview.
