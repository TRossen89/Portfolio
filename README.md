# 💼 Tobias Rossen – Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio. This repository serves as an overview of the projects I’ve worked on — both personal and professional. Some are still in progress, while others are complete or in use.

Feel free to browse the ones available publicly. For any private projects, I’m happy to grant access upon request.

## 📌 Projects

### 1. 🧮 Budget App – [the-budget-app-proto-type](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/the-budget-app-proto-type)
A personal budgeting tool built with Python and the [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home) framework. Though still under development, I actively use it to track and plan my spending over defined periods. The app features dynamic income/expense tracking and supports multiple time windows.

🔧 **Technologies:** Python, Kivy  
📂 **Status:** In use (prototype)

---

### 2. 🎲 Confirmation Board Game – `nanaKonfirmation`
A playful digital board game I built for my cousin’s daughter’s confirmation (*konfirmation*). Developed using Python and Kivy, the game offers a fun, personalized experience.

> 📌 This project is currently private. If you're interested in the code or the concept, feel free to reach out and I’ll be happy to grant access.

🔧 **Technologies:** Python, Kivy  
📂 **Status:** Private – available upon request

### 3. 🔗 Backend API for Project Showcase – [tobias-rossen-backend](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tobias-rossen-backend)
A RESTful backend service designed to support a personal homepage showcasing my work. Built using Java and JPA, the API will provide endpoints for project info, tags, and more.

🔧 **Technologies:** Java, JPA, REST  
📂 **Status:** Work in progress

### 4. 📝 Signup Flow Frontend – Danske Spil
As part of a frontend project for Danske Spil, I built the user-facing sign-up flow using React. I also made minor updates to the backend API (written in ASP.NET C#) to improve data handling and user validation.

> 🔒 This code is proprietary and hosted internally at Danske Spil, so it is not available in this repository.

🔧 **Technologies:** React, ASP.NET C# (API)  
📂 **Status:** Completed – not publicly available

---

### 5. 📣 Message Routing System – Danske Spil
A full-stack enhancement for Danske Spil’s internal messaging system used to notify users about outages and service updates. Previously, messages had to be deleted and recreated to change destinations. I implemented functionality to allow destination updates on existing messages — saving time and reducing friction for the ops team.

> 🔒 This project is also proprietary and hosted internally at Danske Spil.

🔧 **Technologies:** ASP.NET C#, EF Core (backend), Mithril.js (frontend)  
📂 **Status:** Completed – not publicly available

## ❓ Why include private/proprietary projects?

While I can’t share code for some of my work at Danske Spil, I include them to provide insight into the kind of real-world challenges I’ve solved, and the technologies I’ve worked with in a professional setting. I’m happy to discuss any of these in more detail during a conversation or interview.
