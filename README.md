## Tobias Rossen – Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio. This repository provides an overview of selected projects I’ve worked on — including personal, professional, and school-related work. Some are still in progress, while others are complete or in use.

Feel free to browse the publicly available projects. For any private repositories, I’m happy to grant access upon request.  
This portfolio only includes **solo projects**. If you’re interested in the **school projects I’ve collaborated on with fellow students**, I’d be happy to share links to those repositories as well.

I recently completed an internship at Danske Spil A/S, where I contributed to several real-world software solutions. While I can’t share the code from these projects due to confidentiality, I’ve included **descriptions** to give insight into the types of challenges I tackled and the technologies I used in a professional setting.  
I’d be happy to discuss these projects further during a conversation or interview.

## Improvement to Internal Notification System – *Danske Spil A/S*  
#### C#, ASP.NET Core, EF Core, Mithril.js

A full-stack enhancement to Danske Spil’s internal messaging system used to notify users about outages and service updates.  
I implemented functionality allowing staff to update the destination of already-sent messages, eliminating the need to delete and recreate them 
— improving operational efficiency and reducing the risk of human error.  

> This project is proprietary and hosted internally at Danske Spil, so it is not available in this repository.  

  **STATUS:** Ready for QA testing.

## Signup Flow – *Danske Spil A/S*  
#### React, Sitecore *(with minor backend updates in C#, ASP.NET Core/EF Core)*  
 
A frontend project for Danske Spil, where I developed the user-facing sign-up flow using React.  
I also made minor updates to the 
backend API to ensure proper integration, fixing small issues in newly created endpoints.  

> This project is also proprietary and hosted internally at Danske Spil.  

  **STATUS:** In testing. Scheduled for production deployment in fall 2025

## BI Exam - *School project*  
#### Python *(streamlit, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib)*

[View Repository](https://github.com/TRossen89/BI_Exam) 

**Grade:** 12 (A)  

Created as part of a Business Intelligence module in my AP Computer Science (Datamatiker) studies.  
I analyzed data on GDP, social expenditure, 
unemployment, taxation, and happiness across countries to build models predicting the GDP of countries and to visualize interesting relations 
between GDP and happiness, social expenditure, unemployment and taxation.  

**Note:** Install the following dependencies using `pip install` to run the app: `streamlit pandas matplotlib seaborn table scikit-learn`
```bash
pip install streamlit
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install scikit-learn
pip install pandas
pip install table
```
Then, while in the app folder, run
```bash 
streamlit run Frontpage.py
``` 

  **STATUS:** Finished.

## Backend API for Project Showcase
#### Java, JPA  
[View Repository](https://github.com/TRossen89/tobias-rossen-backend)

A RESTful backend service designed to support a personal homepage that showcases my work. The API provides endpoints for project information, tags, video presentations, and more.  
The structure is inspired by several backend projects I built during my studies.

  **STATUS:** In development.

## Budget App  
#### Python, Kivy

[View Repository](https://github.com/TRossen89/the-budget-app-proto-type)

[Video Presentation](https://youtu.be/kqpEPYm2BvE) (2min 28sek - [Video Presentation](https://youtu.be/kqpEPYm2BvE&t=22s))

A personal budgeting app I developed when I first started programming. The repository contains a main branch with 
the original design and a development branch 
where I experimented with various changes.   
Although the app is unfinished and not very user-friendly, I still actively use it to track and plan my spending over defined periods.   
I've decided to stop development on this version and instead start a new project based on a redesigned concept I've worked on. The new version will 
be built using a React frontend and a Java or C# backend.  

**Note:** Install the following dependency using `pip install` to run the app: `kivy`

```bash
pip install kivy
```

  **STATUS:** Not finished. Development discontinued.

## Board Game for a Confirmation (Konfirmation) 
#### Python, Kivy

[Video Presentation](https://youtu.be/NS8SA8iop-M) (functionality demo) 

A playful digital board game I built for my cousin’s daughter’s confirmation (*konfirmation*). 
I packaged it as a standalone executable using PyInstaller. The app can be run directly by navigating to the 
generated dist folder and launching the executable — no Python installation or additional setup required.

> This project is currently private. If you're interested in the code, feel
> free to reach out and I’ll be happy to grant access.  

  **STATUS:** Finished.
